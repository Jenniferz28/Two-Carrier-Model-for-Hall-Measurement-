# Two-Carrier-Model-for-Hall-Measurement-in Topological Materials
Two-carrier model is a widely used model to identify the transport and electronic properties of  topologial semi-metal ( Weyl or Dirac) materials for the Hall conductivity( or resistivity) 
and Longitudinal conductivity ( or resistivity) behavior in magnetici field. Usually the Weyl or Dirac semi-metal mateirals have extremely lare
and non-saturating magnetoresistance, very high mobility of Weyl(or Dirac) fermions. They draw a lot of attention due to the potential 
application in microelectronics and computing.

Inverstigating the electrical properties in semimetallic beta-MoTe2 is part of my Ph.D. thesis. This work was done to analyaze the electron and hole mobilities and carrier density in semi-metallic beta-MoTe2 and its topological properteis in magnetic field. It is published in Physical Review B Rapid Communications on 1 September 2016 https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.121101

Later I also deployed this model in Python on several other Weyl semimetal materials like WP2, Ti2Te2P, Zr2Te2P, ZrSiTe .
