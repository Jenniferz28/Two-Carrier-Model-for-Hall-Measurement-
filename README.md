# Two-Carrier-Model-for-Hall-Measurement-
Two-carrier model is a generally used to identify the transport and electronic properties of  topologial semi-metal ( Weyl or Dirac) materials for the Hall conductivity( or resistivity) 
and Longitudinal conductivity ( or resistivity) behavior in magnetici field. Usually the Weyl or Dirac semi-metal mateirals have extremely lare
and non-saturating magnetoresistance, very high mobility of Weyl(or Dirac) fermions. They draw a lot of attention due to the potential 
application in microelectronics and computing.
